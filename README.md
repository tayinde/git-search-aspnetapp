# git-search-aspnetapp
The project can be seen live [here](https://git-aspnet-search.herokuapp.com/). This program allows you to search for users on Github. This project is the first ASP.NET app that I have made.
## Run program
The [.NET Core CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) must be installed to run this program. After that is installed, you can simply run `dotnet run` in the root directory of the project. The app should now be running on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
