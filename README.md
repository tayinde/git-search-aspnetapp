# git-search-aspnetapp
This program allows you to search for users on Github. This project is the first ASP.NET app that I have made.
##Run program
The .NET Core CLI must be installed to run this program. After that is installed, you can simply run `dotnet run` in the root directory of the project. The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`
